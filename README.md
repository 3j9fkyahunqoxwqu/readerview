# Reader View

As described on the Firefox support page, Reader View strips away clutter like buttons, ads, and background images, and changes the page's text size, contrast, and layout for better readability. This add-on brings that functionality to Pale Moon.

## Usage

This extension adds a button with the Reader Mode icon to the Pale Moon interface. When the add-on detects that a page is compatible with Reader View, the button will enable and the icon will turn blue. Clicking the button will enable Reader View for that page, and the icon will turn purple. Clicking the button again will exit Reader View, and the page will return to normal.

Reader View may also be activated by selecting "Enter Reader View" from the View menu, or by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + R.

Many features in Reader View are identical between Mozilla Firefox and this add-on, such as:

* Parse and render a page cleanly and clutter-free
* Activated with the simple click of a button
* Increase or decrease the line spacing between text
* Increase or decrease the font size
* Choose from light, dark, or sepia color schemes

This add-on comes with a few differences, such as:

* Reading time estimates are based on English only.
* Text to speech/narration is not available.
* Pocket integration is not available.
* Telemetry is not included.

This add-on is available from the Pale Moon add-ons site:

Happy reading!
